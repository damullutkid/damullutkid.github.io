In this project I am creating a classification model.

# The Problem/Question & The Data

My model will attempt to decide if someone is approved for a loan based on 11 features. The 11 features are:

    * Gender: Male or Female
    * Married: Married or Not Married
    * Dependents: 1, 2, or 3+
    * Education: Graduate or Undergraduate
    * Employment: Self-employed or not self-employed
    * Income: In Dollars
    * Coapplicent Income: In Dollars 
    * Loan Amount: In Thousands
    * Loan Terms: In months
    * Credit History: If credit history meets requirements for the loan
    * Property Area: Semi-Urban, Urban, or Rural 

My data set was retrieved from Kaggle here (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/loan-status-prediction/data). One problem I encountered with this dataset is that the author did not provide information on where he pulled all the data. This is a concern, but the data does not have any errors, all formats are consistent within columns and there is information provided about what each column means.
