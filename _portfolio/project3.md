# The Problem/Question & The Data

My model will attempt to decide if someone is approved for a loan based on 11 features. The 11 features are:
    * Gender
    * Married
    * Dependents
    * Education 
    * Employment
    * Income 
    * Coapplicent Income 
    * Loan Amount 
    * Loan Terms
    * Credit History
    * Property Area
